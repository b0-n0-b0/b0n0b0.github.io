I'm b0n0b0, Computer Engineering student @ Universit√† di Pisa.

I play CTFs in the [fibonhack](https://fibonhack.it/) team, and I'm currently working as a security analyst in [codean labs](https://codeanlabs.com/).

I like understanding stuff and then trying to break it. I love weightlifting, and I won the knucklebone world championship 3 times: check the last year winning clip [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-P2zXNtEDG/), it's cool!

I collect comics and original drawings, I read a stupid amount of sci-fi novels and I love to yap about it.

Recently discovered that I like hikings. That's all folks!
